TO DO:

- (Done) comparisons
- (Done) reducers: any, all
- (Done) Boolean masks (requires dtypes. would be only number and bool)
- (Done) logical operations
- (Done) numbers in -1.4e-3 notation
- (Done) isclose
- (Done) Concurrency: the variables are being replaced with a global variable
- (Done) First integration to D3JS inside the notebook
- (DONE) shortcut reduce of any and all and allclose
- (DONE) linspace and geomspace
- (DONE) sign, abs, exp, log, sin, cos, sinh, cosh, asin, asin, ...
- (DONE) Round
- (DONE) arguments
- (DONE) ellipsis in slices
- (DONE) Better support for kwargs using this 
- (DONE) npm and license
- (DONE) (can be improved) improve assignment: options have add(A,B, out=..., where=...) they have `__iadd__ = add(A, B, A) ` and define array views. I should do the same, but views take time, I think. They also say `.reshape() creates a view` and `advanced indexing creates a copy` and `It must be noted here that during the assignment of x[[1, 2]] = [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]], no view or copy is created as the assignment happens in-place.`. So, `y = x[[1, 2]]` creates a copy but `y = x[1:3]` creates a view. According to my experiments, "advanced indexing" occurs when the sliceSpec contains boolean masks or integer indices. For fixed integer, range slices, ellipsis, 'None', and ':'.
- (DONE) List all the functions that access array.flat
- (DONE) compose simple indexes
- (DONE) Print in different format
- (DONE) Handle the or operator "|" properly: for booleans gives booleans. For numbers gives numbers. 
- (DONE) parser should not return to_list, should it?
- (DONE) Support for 128 bits dtype? (Nope. I don't use that much, and js does not support that natively)

- make the module callable
- provide to calls: if template string... otherwise, asarray np`...` np(...)


- separate these as core: slice, _binary_operator, _assign_operator, _reduce, _apply, "_transform" (e.g. sort)



- is there a way to copy the jsdoc of another function, but replacing the first argument?

- np.where
- maximum and minimum with ↑ and ↓. What priority wr to + *, ** and the logical operators?

- enable GeneralSliceSpec to accept string '::-1' instead of already parsed range object.

- Optimize with webpack
- Add license to webpack

- Get click to work in Guake
- What about np`statement; \n statement;\n ...;\n return blah, blah, blah`

- purposeful readme, with plots and good examples

- search for autogenerated docs options
- speed up tests by running several python tests at once. Maybe printing to file?

- np.sort, np."sorted"
- np.random.shuffle, np.random."shuffled", np.random.normal
- np.unique
- np.stack, np.concatenate, np.dstack, etc.

- allow A.op['+'](B) syntax

- group_by function
- np.split
- np.cov
- np.hist
- np.bins


- np.d3_snippets: examples

- Write concurrency tests
- Random module
- Linalg module
